		Throughout my childhood, I have seen many different creations of shows,
		movies, and games that greatly impacted me.
		When I was younger, seeing all these creations of my favorite games and shows made me want to grow up and make my own things that I can be proud of.
		When I was 9 years old I wanted to create robots that were like stuffed animals but able to move like a real person and talk to people like how a
		real person could. I gave up that idea and wanted to create 3D animated videos instead when I turned 13 years old so that I could have a way to bring
		my imagination to life. The video games in my life made me want to switch to learning how to code games when I turned 16 years old. The creations
		that people made during my time as a child helped me choose what I wanted to do with my life and inspired me to be like the people who were behind
		some of my favorite things.<br> I still do not know what I want to do sometimes, I try to look back at my childhood to think about what younger me would
		think and want to do. I do not always have the energy to do my work, so thinking about my childhood can help motivate me to try and make myself proud.
		I had some hard times trying to learn the stuff I liked as a kid, so I always just moved on trying to find somthing else to learn when I got stuck.
		I am tring to learn how to code web sites and other stuff because I wanted to do something where can still make things that my younger self would be
		intersted in. I still remember when I would take apart my toys as a kid because I wanted to learn how they worked, like a Wall-E toy that I still have
		today, but had missing parts now.
